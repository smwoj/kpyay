React app that allows you to view the data, compose the charts into views and save them.

Based on [this template](https://github.com/chunliu/typescript-react-hot-reload). 

Once you start the server + redis  - possibly with some mock content inserted via `utils/spawn_mock_server.py` - 
you can check out the app via `npm start`. `spawn_mock_server.py` also 
creates a demo view - `http::/localhost:8088/show-stuff`.
